## Prerequisites ##

To successfully complete this demo, it is helpful if you have a basic understanding of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).  The marker tool is used to create "**GitHub Flavored Markdown**" (gfm).  Read the following links to gain a solid understanding of gfm.

<a name="Setup" />
## Setup##

Before starting this demo, you must:

- Download the **[marker.zip](./Downloads/Marker.zip)** file and extract it to a folder on your computer. 
	- Run the **"Marker.exe"** tool to launch Marker.  You may want to place a shortcut to the .exe file on your start screen, taskbar or desktop.
	- The first time you run **"Marker.exe"** it may prompt you to associate the **&lowast;.md** file extenion with Marker.  Allow the association. If you need to reset the association again, you can do it from the Marker's menu bar, and the **"Tools"** |

- Download and install the **[Sizer](http://www.brianapps.net/sizer/)** utility.  Sizer makes it easy to resize a window to a specific size.  It is recommended that you use a reference dimension of 1024x768 for your screen shots.  Sizer helps you set windows specifically to that size.

- If you have access to **[SnagIt from Techsmith](http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html)**, I highly recommend using that as a screen shot utility.  It makes it simple to create and edit screenshots for use in your demos.

- Set the Windows Theme on your PC to match the other content creators.  This makes it significantly easier to update screenshots in the future.  

	- First, back up your current theme so you can switch back to it later. Right click on your desktop, and select **"Personalize"** from the pop-up menu.  The save the current **"Unsaved Theme"** to a name.  You can then use that saved theme name to restore your theme in the future.

	- Download the **[ResolutionsCentered.deskthemepack](./Downloads/ResolutionsCentered.deskthemepack)** file to your pc (anywhere you like), then double click on the downloaded file to apply the theme.

## Tasks ##

This demo is comprised of the following tasks:

- [Creating a Demo Script](#Task1)
- [Adding Code](#Task2) 
- [Adding Screen Shots](#Task3)

<a name="Task1" />
## Creating a Demo Script ##

In this task, you'll create a basic demo script using the template.  

1. Download the [Demo.zip](./Downloads/Demo.zip) file to a folder on your PC.  

1. Right-click on the downloaded file, and select **"Properties"** from the pop-up menu:

1. Open the file in Marker.exe 

	> **Note:** if the file associations were created earlier

````C#
void Main() {
	int x = 1;
	int y = 2;
	int z = x + y;
	Console.WriteLine(z);
}
````
1. Do _That_ - I try to keep my screen shots to no bigger than 1024x768.  That is still bigger than what the Marker tool recommends, but it has worked well for me previously.
