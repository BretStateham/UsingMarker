## Tasks ##

This demo is comprised of the following tasks:

- [Task 1](#Task1)
- [Task 2](#Task2)

<a name="Task1" />
## Task 1 ##

In this task we'll......

1. Do **This** using this code:

````C#
void Main() {
	int x = 1;
	int y = 2;
	int z = x + y;
	Console.WriteLine(z);
}
````
1. Do _That_ - I try to keep my screen shots to no bigger than 1024x768.  That is still bigger than what the Marker tool recommends, but it has worked well for me previously.
